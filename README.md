# OU Parking App
## Description
We are developing an app that aims to help OU Students find parking around and on the OU campus reducing stress and wasted time. The app will collect information from students about their schedules and the app's AI will estimate parking availability of specific lots at different times. This app would help alleviate some problems with the scarcity of OU parking spaces and empty spots.

## Usage
Keeps track of open parking, helps students find the least busy parking areas within range of their classes, and uses AI in order to create a parking schedule based on student class times.
## Roadmap
Brainstorm desired programming language and app features and improvements.
Implement Scrumplan and testing plans.
