# OU Parking App
## Description
We are developing an app that aims to help OU Students find parking around and on the OU campus reducing stress and wasted time. The app will collect information from students about their schedules and the app's AI will estimate parking availability of specific lots at different times. This app would help alleviate some problems with the scarcity of OU parking spaces and empty spots.

## Usage
Users from the University of Oklahoma will input their schedules as guided to do in the app. The student will then be able to view the “Find a Spot” tab in the app to see a list of recommended parking structures from the AI. By selecting a parking structure the student will be able to view a list of time slots and the likely number of spots available at each time. They will also be able to input a date and time to receive more specific information.

## Roadmap

### Hard Data
Collect all hard data that is necessary e.g lot locations, parking space counts, etc.

Continue to update any data as poarking structures and maps change on campus.

### AI
Create an AI tailored to our specifications

Train the AI on parking behavior of OU Students

Revisit any bugs that arise with test input

Finalize AI for initial small release

Revisit any bugs that arise in initial release
