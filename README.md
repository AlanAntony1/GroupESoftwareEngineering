# OU Parking App
## Description
We are developing an app that aims to help OU Students find parking around and on the OU campus reducing stress and wasted time. The app will collect information from students about their schedules and the app's AI will estimate parking availability of specific lots at different times. This app would help alleviate some problems with the scarcity of OU parking spaces and empty spots.

## Usage
Users from the University of Oklahoma will input their schedules as guided to do in the app. The student will then be able to view the “Find a Spot” tab in the app to see a list of recommended parking structures from the AI. By selecting a parking structure the student will be able to view a list of time slots and the likely number of spots available at each time. They will also be able to input a date and time to receive more specific information.

## Downloading and Running the app or Test Cases

Users may download the app for themselves in order to run locally or run tests.

Must have python installed before running any commands, otherwise the project will not work.

Start by downloading the ZIP file from GitHub and extracting it.

Then, either open the folder in VSCode and use the built-in terminal or navigate to the folder's location using Terminal or Command Prompt.

Running the Applicaton: Enter the following into the terminal window - python manage.py runserver

Running the Test Cases: Enter the following into the terminal window - python manage.py test

## Roadmap

### Hard Data
Collect all hard data that is necessary e.g lot locations, parking space counts, etc.

Continue to update any data as parking structures and maps change on campus.

### AI 
Create an AI tailored to our specifications

Train the AI on parking behavior of OU Students

Revisit any bugs that arise with test input

Finalize AI for initial small release

Revisit any bugs that arise in initial release

Finalize AI for full release

Continue maintenance based on consumer feedback

### Test Input
Create test input of student schedules to be used by the AI

Expand text input based on test results and increase variety of data, to be repeated multiple times

### App Creation
Design a student-facing app that allows for easy use of the product

Test the app in small batches, release to one college at a time

Fully release the app to all OU students
